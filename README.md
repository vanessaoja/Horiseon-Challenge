# <Horiseon-Challenge>


- The motivation was to create a webpage that follows SEO standards.
- I built this project in order to practice my skills in html and css
- Problems including layout, working links, images that were viewable, and tags that were too similar to diffientriate. 
- This challenge taught me how important div tools are while viewing a webpage
